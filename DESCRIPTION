Title: Clinical Trial Designs in 'rstan'
Description: A collection of clinical trial designs and methods, implemented in 
    'rstan' and R, including: the Continual Reassessment Method by O'Quigley et 
    al. (1990) <doi:10.2307/2531628>; EffTox by Thall & Cook (2004) 
    <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00218.x>; the two-parameter logistic method of
    Neuenschwander, Branson & Sponer (2008) <doi:10.1002/sim.3230>; and the 
    Augmented Binary method by Wason & Seaman (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5867>; and
    more. We provide functions to aid model-fitting and analysis. 
    The 'rstan' implementations may also serve as a cookbook to anyone looking 
    to extend or embellish these models. We hope that this package encourages 
    the use of Bayesian methods in clinical trials. There is a preponderance of 
    early phase trial designs because this is where Bayesian methods are used 
    most. If there is a method you would like implemented, please get in touch.
