Title: Clinical Trial Designs in 'RStan'
Description: A showcase of Bayesian clinical trial designs, implemented in 
    'RStan' and R. Some designs are implemented in R for the first
    time (e.g. 'EffTox' by Thall and Cook, 2004, 
    <https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/softwaredownload/SingleSoftware.aspx?Software_Id=2>). 
    Given the emphasis on flexibility in Bayesian analysis,
    the implementations in a common language and style may serve as a cookbook
    to encourage the use of Bayesian methods in trials. Compiled 'RStan' models
    are provided in addition to helper classes and functions to perform 
    simulations and inference on observed trial outcomes. 
    There is a preponderance of early phase trial designs because this is where 
    Bayesian methods are used most. If there is a published Bayesian design you
    want implemented in 'Stan', get in touch.
