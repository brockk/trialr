Title: Clinical Trial Designs in 'RStan'
Description: A showcase of Bayesian clinical trial designs, implemented in 
    'RStan' and R, including the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and EffTox.
    Given the emphasis on flexibility in Bayesian analysis,
    the implementations in a common language and style may serve as a cookbook
    to encourage the use of Bayesian methods in trials. Compiled 'RStan' models
    are installed, alongside helper classes and functions to work with models.
    There is a preponderance of early phase trial designs because this is where 
    Bayesian methods are used most. If there is a published Bayesian design you
    want implemented in 'Stan', get in touch.
